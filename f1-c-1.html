    <h1>Avengers:Endgame</h1>
    <p>After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in
        ruins due to the efforts of the Mad
        Titan, Thanos. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers must assemble once more in order to undo Thanos's
        actions
        and undo the chaos to the universe, no matter what consequences may be in store, and no matter who they face...
        After half of all life is snapped away by Thanos, the Avengers are left scattered and divided. Now with a way to
        reverse
        the damage, the Avengers and their allies must assemble once more and learn to put differences aside in order to
        work
        together and set things right. Along the way, the Avengers realize that sacrifices must be made as they prepare
        for the
        ultimate final showdown with Thanos, which will result in the heroes fighting the biggest battle they have ever
        faced.
